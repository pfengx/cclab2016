// the cloud seer //


the cloud seer is a photobooth for those that want to be invisible and obfuscated on their own terms.  With the ubiquity of surveillance technology, primarily targeting communities of color with the use of machine learning (artificial intelligence), we need a new way to exist online and a new ability to see one another.

this project is inspired by the following:
- the poetry and surrealism of hiding, mystery, and reality by French artist Rene Magritte
- this quote from the Yoga Sutra: "the seer resides in [her] own nature"
- current abilities of AI technology to read through pixelated images (https://www.wired.com/2016/09/machine-learning-can-identify-pixelated-faces-researchers-show/)
